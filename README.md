# HNN24

This codebase is developed upon [Hyperbolic Convolution via Kernel Point Aggregation](https://github.com/EricZQu/Hyperbolic-Convolution-via-Kernel-Point-Aggregation). However, in this version, we added operations in Poincare and Klein(partial), and have implemented new means for aggregations.
